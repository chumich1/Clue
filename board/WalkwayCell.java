/*
 * Class: WalkwayCell, child of BoardCell
 * Authors: Brandon Rodriguez, Hunter Lang
 * This class is used to keep track of the walkway cells in the game.
 * At the current moment is barebones, but has the boolean function "isWalkway" returning true and will be used to draw differently on the gui
